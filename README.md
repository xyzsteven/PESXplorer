# PESXplorer - PES 2021 Player Database üìä

A fast, client-side web application for searching, filtering, and comparing every player based on **PES 2021 VirtuaRED.com Patch (v9.4)**.

This project is a 100% static site (HTML, CSS, JS) that runs entirely in the browser.

    * General Position (GK, DF, MF, FW)
    * Specific Position (CB, RWF, CMF, etc.)
    * Overall Rating (Min/Max range)

## üõ†Ô∏è Running Locally

This project cannot be run by opening the `index.html` file directly from your filesystem (e.g., `file:///...`). The browser's security policy (CORS) will block the script from fetching the `players.json` file.

You **must** serve the files using a local web server. The easiest way is with the **Live Server** extension in VS Code.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/xyzsteven/PESXplorer.git
    ```
2.  **Open the folder** in VS Code.
3.  **Install** the [**Live Server**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension from the VS Code Marketplace.
4.  **Right-click** on `index.html` in the VS Code Explorer.
5.  Select **"Open with Live Server"**.

Your browser will automatically open to `http://127.0.0.1:5500` (or a similar port), and the application will be fully functional.
